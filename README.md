Objective:
Allow audience to vote on their favorite Star Wars Characters.

November 9: I struggled with this assignment mightily and basically did nothing for the entire lab time today. I had to come home and look at other people's code to figure things out.  Overall, this class is just not going well with me and honestly I'm not sure if I'm cut out for this type of career.  At this point, I am just modifying code and not learning much of anything.
